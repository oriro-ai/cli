summary: "Zalo OriroBot channel setup through the external oriro-zaloorirobot plugin"
read_when:
  - You want a personal Zalo assistant bot with QR-code login
  - You are installing or troubleshooting the oriro-zaloorirobot channel plugin
title: "Zalo OriroBot"
---

Oriro connects to Zalo OriroBot through the catalog-listed external
`@zalo-platforms/oriro-zaloorirobot` plugin. Login uses a Zalo Mini App QR
code.

## Compatibility

| Plugin Version | Oriro Version | npm dist-tag | Status        |
| -------------- | ---------------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| 0.1.x          | >=2026.4.10      | `latest`     | Active / Beta |

## Prerequisites

- Node.js **>= 22**
- [Oriro](https://docs.oriro.ai/install) must be installed (`oriro` CLI available).
- A Zalo account on a mobile device to scan the login QR code.

## Install with onboard (recommended)

Run the Oriro onboarding wizard and pick **Zalo OriroBot** from the channel menu:

```bash
oriro onboard
```

The wizard installs the plugin from the official catalog (integrity-verified), renders the login QR right in the terminal, and finishes the channel once you scan it with the Zalo app. No extra commands are needed.

## Manual Installation

To add the channel to an already-onboarded gateway, follow these steps:

### 1. Install the plugin

```bash
oriro plugins install "@zalo-platforms/oriro-zaloorirobot@0.1.4"
```

Use the exact pinned version shown above (it matches the official catalog entry), so Oriro verifies the package against the catalog integrity hash during install.

### 2. Enable the plugin in config

```bash
oriro config set plugins.entries.oriro-zaloorirobot.enabled true
```

### 3. Generate QR code and log in

```bash
oriro channels login --channel oriro-zaloorirobot
```

Scan the terminal-rendered QR code using the Zalo mobile app, accept the Terms of Use inside the Zalo Mini App, and authorize the session.

### 4. Restart the gateway

```bash
oriro gateway restart
```

## How It Works

Unlike the standard developer Zalo channel which requires you to register your own Zalo Official Account (OA) and paste static developer credentials, Zalo OriroBot operates as an **owner-bound personal assistant** using a shared, official infrastructure:

1. **Secure Onboarding:** The QR code resolves to a secure Zalo Mini App that binds a newly-provisioned, private bot under a shared official OA directly to your Zalo User ID.
2. **Owner-Bound Privacy:** By design, the bot is restricted to communicating _only_ with its owner. Messages from other users are dropped at the platform level, making the connection private and secure.
3. **Official API path:** The plugin uses Zalo Bot Platform APIs instead of
   browser or web-session automation.

## Under the Hood

The Zalo OriroBot plugin communicates with Zalo APIs via a persistent long-polling message loop. To maintain a clean and lightweight runtime:

- Long-poll connections utilize the `getUpdates` endpoint.
- Webhooks are disabled by default for local desktop/terminal gateway runs.
- Messages are processed client-side and mapped directly to your local agent runtime.

The external plugin manages bot credentials under the Oriro state directory.
Treat that directory as sensitive and include it in the same access-control and
backup policy as the rest of your Oriro state.

## Troubleshooting

- **QR Login Timeout:** The login token (`zbsk`) expires after 5 minutes for security reasons. If the QR code expires before you scan it, simply rerun the login command to generate a new one.
- **Gateway Fails to Load:** Ensure your Oriro host version is `2026.4.10` or higher. Older versions do not support the external npm-plugin installation ledger.
